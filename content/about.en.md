## Background and Development

I grew up in the Alpine region and live in Tyrol today. My educational path led me through a non-traditional route, first to physics studies and subsequently to training in computer science. Today I work professionally as a computer scientist.

In parallel, I have been intensively engaged with natural sciences and philosophy since my early youth. From the beginning, questions about knowledge, reality, and human action stood at the center, combined with the aspiration to work through these questions with conceptual clarity and methodological rigor.

## Foundations

The epistemological basis of my work is critical rationalism in the tradition of Karl Popper, Hans Albert, and William Warren Bartley. Additionally, evolutionary epistemology, particularly in the elaboration of Gerhard Vollmer, plays a central role.

Ontologically, I advocate hypothetical realism and emergent materialism in the sense of Mario Bunge, understood as a position of weak emergence.

## Influences and Areas of Focus

My work is interdisciplinary in character. Beyond physics and biology, I systematically incorporate insights from evolutionary research, behavioral science, sociology, psychology, and neuroscience, complemented by decision and game theory as well as economic considerations, particularly from liberal traditions.

Important points of reference include Konrad Lorenz, Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt, Antonio Damasio, Robert Sapolsky, and Daniel Kahneman, as well as Friedrich August von Hayek and Nassim Nicholas Taleb, whose work on uncertainty, ignorance, and unknown risks is of central importance to me because it consistently applies critical rationalism in practice and transfers it from the realm of pure philosophy of science into the core of real decision-making under uncertainty.

## Philosophical Tradition

I stand in the tradition of Aristotle as well as the skeptical and empirically oriented currents of antiquity, and understand philosophy as rationally testable, science-adjacent work. I do not stand in the Platonic, idealistic school, which is incompatible with modern epistemology, critical rationalism, and contemporary scientific knowledge.

## Current Work

My current core project is a critical-rationalist, evolutionary ethics that combines insights from the natural sciences with critical-rational principles. Several texts are in preparation for this purpose, including scientific papers, accompanying clarifications, and examinations of alternative ethical and metaethical positions.

Alongside the scientific work, a book project is developing that will unfold these themes in a broader context and make them accessible to a wider audience.

## Purpose of This Website

This website consolidates my scientific work and accessible texts in one place. It serves as an entry point to central questions and as a navigation point to further publications and projects.
