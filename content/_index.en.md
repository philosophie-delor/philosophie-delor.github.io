# Philosophical Foundations of a Rational Ethics

The focus of this site lies on developing a critical-rational, evolutionary ethics.
At its center stands the question of how normative statements about human action can be justified without dogmatism and without breaking with scientific knowledge.

Ethics presupposes a viable epistemological foundation. I see this in critical rationalism.
At the same time, ethics without reference to empirical knowledge is empty, while science without philosophical reflection remains disoriented.
Philosophy and science therefore do not form an opposition but a necessary reciprocal relationship.

Besides scientific publications, you will find essays and generally accessible presentations here.
The site is under construction and will be gradually expanded.
